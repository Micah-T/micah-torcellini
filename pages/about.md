Good day! I am Micah Torcellini, a Swamp Yankee from the land of Swamp Yankees, namely, Northeastern Connecticut. 

I also happen to be a:
- [web developer](/developing/).
- Language nerd
- Music nerd
- Legal nerd (in the sense of being nerdy about law, not in the sense that I have a certificate called "Certificate of Nerdiness," though I could probably qualify for one if it was a thing)
- History nerd
- [I also happen to write stuff sometimes.](/writing/)
