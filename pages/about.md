Good day! I am Micah Torcellini, a Swamp Yankee from the land of Swamp Yankees, namely, Northeastern Connecticut.

What is a Swamp Yankee? Well, the adjective Swamp modifies the noun Yankee. Think of a Yankee. Then think of a Yankee with swamp-like character.

I also happen to be a:
- [Web developer](/developing/).
- Language nerd (Saepe Latine loqui conor&hellip;)
- Music nerd
- Legal nerd (in the sense of being nerdy about law, not in the sense that I have a certificate called "Certificate of Nerdiness," though I could probably qualify for one if it was a thing)
- History nerd
- [I also write sometimes, often on the above topics. Please report anything heretical.](/writing/)
