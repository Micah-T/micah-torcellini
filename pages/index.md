# I have opinions. They may change, but they remain correct.
Do not challenge them. If I am open-minded, my brain will fall out.

Good day! I am Micah Torcellini, a Swamp Yankee from the land of Swamp Yankees, namely, Northeastern Connecticut. Swamp Yankee are responsible for the well-known New England cynicism created by the cold. We live in the past because the rent is cheaper.

What is a Swamp Yankee? Well, the adjective Swamp modifies the noun Yankee. Think of a Yankee. Then think of a Yankee with swamp-like character.

You are a group of unlucky people who have landed on this website.

You know mommy blogs? This is like one, but it's an old guy blog.

I also happen to be a:
- [Web developer because the internet needs better websites: I intend to improve the ratio of good-per-bad websites.](/developing/).
- Language nerd (Saepe Latine loqui conor&hellip;) because I need words to talk with.
- Music nerd: Bach is better than it sounds.
- Legal nerd (in the sense that I learned law because I was going to sue over defamation of character. Then I found I have no character.
- History nerd, that I may know when it repeats itself.
- [I also write sometimes, often on the above topics. Please report anything heretical.](/writing/)
- I am also interested in politics. I am also interested in human depravity. I suppose this is repetition, however.

Feast your eyes on this meme and you will know the truth.

I gave my brother edit power to this website. Great power comes with great issues. Everything you like about this website is most likely his.
