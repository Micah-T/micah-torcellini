# I have opinions. They may change, but they remain correct.
Good day! I am Micah Torcellini, a Swamp Yankee from the land of Swamp Yankees, namely, Northeastern Connecticut. 

You are a group of unlucky people who have landed on this website.

You know mommy blogs? This is like one, but it's an old guy blog.

I also happen to be a:
- [web developer](/developing/).
- Language nerd (Saepe Latine loqui conor&hellip;)
- Music nerd
- Legal nerd (in the sense of being nerdy about law, not in the sense that I have a certificate called "Certificate of Nerdiness," though I could probably qualify for one if it was a thing)
- History nerd
- [I also write sometimes, often on the above topics.](/writing/)
- I am also interested in politics. I am also interested in human depravity. I suppose this is repetition, however.

Feast your eyes on this meme and you will know the truth.

![I am a Calvinist. You are a Dispensationalist. I believe that we are the Kingdom and the Kingdom is now. You believe the world is so bad we will be 'raptured.' Now, who believes in gospel success?](/assets/images/edwards-meme.jpeg)

I gave my brother edit power to this website. Great power comes with great issues.
