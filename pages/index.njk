<p>Greetings! I am Micah Torcellini. I originate from the swamps of Connecticut. While my internet reputation primarily concerns <a href="https://scrambletheduck.org">Scramble the Duck</a>, in real life I am a M.A. student in <a href="https://blogs.iu.edu/jsommusicology/">musicology at Indiana University.</a> I also enjoy developing websites, thinking about liberal arts in general, and tinkering with harpsichords. If you want to learn more about what I do, <a href="/resume/">my resume might be interesting.</a></p>
