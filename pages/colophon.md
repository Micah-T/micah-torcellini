All writing, unless otherwise noted, is my own. I hand-coded this website. The body is set in EB Garamond, and the headings in Cormorant Garamond. The initials are [Euclid Initials](https://www.c82.net/euclid/about/), originally made for this fascinating [digital reproduction of Byrne's Euclid](https://www.c82.net/euclid/). Soli Deo Gloria.
