*I gave this introduction before a performance of this suite at a recital.* {.no-dropcap}

This piece is a dance suite, or, rather, it is at least in its form. By
Bach's time, composers would often use the form of a dance suite without
intending for the piece to be danced; to me, the presence of an aria seems
to indicate so here (who would attempt to dance an aria?[^1]).{.dropcap}

Johann Mattheson described the key of E♭ major as "pathetic; concerned
with serious and plaintive things; bitterly hostile to all
lasciviousness."[^2] (For those of you who think in twenty-first century language,
"pathetic" here means "emotionally expressive."[^3]) Indeed this 
seems to be the general ethos of this
piece. While it expresses no volatile mirth, it is contemplative
throughout. Even the joyous gigue (the most mirthful of the baroque
dances) expresses a sort of restrained, pious jubilance. Perhaps,
though, the most representative part of the suite is the aria in the
middle, which coalesces the whole into a coherent unit. The allemande at
the opening sets the tone for the suite, the courante expounds this
dignified joy, the sarabande explores the various facets of the joy
in its remoter harmonies, the gavotte anchors the aria, and the
gigue demonstrates the glorious conclusion of this all.

In a way, then, this suite can serve as a meditation on Christian piety,
by which we can have simple joy.
