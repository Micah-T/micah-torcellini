## <i>Swingin' Harpsichord</i>, Bruce Prince-Joseph
Harpsichordists are usually associated with pretentious performance of old music which *might* be hard to understand (hence, names such as the "Academy of Ancient Music," "Collegium Musicum," "Early Music Society," and others--don't they sound pretentious?). In order to try to dispel any appearance of pretentiousness, we then try to force our brains to function as if it were after 1750. This is altogether impossible, but it often results in interesting things. 

One of such interesting things is jazz. It's popular and modern, yet has more than four chords to play with, and melodies which sound melodic (a novelty to much popular music). Besides, the baroque period was a period of experimentation with tonality, just like jazz. The harpsichord, since it has an even more definite ictus than the piano, can emphasize unique rhythms, and since it has a brighter timbre with more overtones, spicy chords sound spicier. 

A violist friend send a recording from this album, in which [Bruce Prince-Joseph plays various jazzy favorites on the harpsichord](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mZubUOUqo5gR5chbGrtkTfZraLJCKo8iI). He executes the transcriptions well, and captures the spirit of both the jazz and the harpsichord. The only complaint which I have is that he uses what seems to be a Pleyel harpsichord. These harpsichords were built like pianos, meaning that the [asthetic advantages of the harpsichord which I wrote about previously](https://micah.torcellini.org/2022/02/08/ahern-on-the-harpsichord/) are not as present, aside from its definite ictus and bright timbre. Even Landowska is not exempt from such criticism; while she understands and performs music quite well, her choice of instrument compromises her recordings. Prince-Joseph must be reviewed similarly: he plays good music well, but on an less-than-ideal instrument. This is an interesting concept, though, and I would be interested to continue what he has done here. This is a recording well-worth listening to.
