    title: Erictho and the Manipulation of Memory in Bellum Civile
    journal: Westmarch
    date: 2022
    url: "/erictho-and-memory/"
    summary: "Lucan’s Bellum Civile serves as a eulogy for the Republic, in which he expresses his agony about its death. For the Romans, remembering was an important part of proper piety, and proper remembering required proper rites of remembrance. Bellum Civile serves as this sort of rite. To construct such a monument to the Republic, however, Lucan must demonstrate that he has the power to do this, which he does in the Erictho episode. The Erictho episode also serves as a discussion of the importance of memory. Thus, in mourning the Republic, Lucan both makes a memory of it and destroys and manipulates that very memory; the Erictho episode serves as a cornerstone of Lucan’s mastery over memory."
