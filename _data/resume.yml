    title: "Philip the Chancellor: Music and Poetry on Virtue and Humanity"
    date: 2026
    venue: Society for Christian Scholarship in Music (February) and International Congress of Medieval Studies (May)
    summary: "While Leonin and Perotin’s contributions to music are common knowledge, the intellectual environment that nurtured them in Paris deserves deeper examination. One figure within this philosophical and musical milieu, Philip the Chancellor, is pivotal for understanding the sounds, ideas, and struggles of thirteenth-century Paris, as has been highlighted by Thomas Payne. This paper examines the relationship between the intellectual environment of the time, Philip’s own philosophy, and the music associated with his circle, focusing on Philip’s expression of virtue ethics in his poetry, with special consideration of the context of the university culture of disputation and Philip’s own treatise <i>De Bono</i>. In addition, this paper seeks to reconcile some difficult translation problems through an understanding of Philip’s doctrine of humanity, particularly his idea of the interaction between Soul, Flesh, and Reason. Philip’s pursuit of virtue extends beyond theological and philosophical speculation to a practical pursuit of truth and justice. Philip criticizes corrupt clergy in <i>In Veritate Comperi / Veritatem</i>, while the tenor and other musical aspects emphasize that his ultimate concern is for truth, which is learned from Reason in <i>Anima, Iuge Lacrima</i> and “Christ the truth” in <i>Doce nos hodie / Docebit</i>. In addition, musical aspects of these pieces also parallel the intellectual environment of the time and how Philip thought of moral action within that context. In <i>Anima, Iuge Lacrima</i>, for example, the musical portrayal of academic disputation (as discussed in Novikoff 2013) corresponds to the spiritual struggle against worldly temptation. This paper also considers issues of authorship, examining what poetry can explain about someone’s environment considering both philosophical and aesthetic factors, even when exact attribution may be impossible."

    title: Erictho and the Manipulation of Memory in Bellum Civile
    journal: Westmarch
    date: 2022
    url: "/erictho-and-memory/"
    summary: "Lucan’s Bellum Civile serves as a eulogy for the Republic, in which he expresses his agony about its death. For the Romans, remembering was an important part of proper piety, and proper remembering required proper rites of remembrance. Bellum Civile serves as this sort of rite. To construct such a monument to the Republic, however, Lucan must demonstrate that he has the power to do this, which he does in the Erictho episode. The Erictho episode also serves as a discussion of the importance of memory. Thus, in mourning the Republic, Lucan both makes a memory of it and destroys and manipulates that very memory; the Erictho episode serves as a cornerstone of Lucan’s mastery over memory."
