No other instrument emanates the same aura of majesty as the Church
organ. It is an incredibly complex instrument with an equally complex
history. Beginning with the simple *hydraulis* of the ancient Romans,
the organ has had a long and varied history. During the early modern
period, the diverse regional organ-building traditions developed
simultaneously as did distinct regional musical traditions, until
Napoleon[^1] and the Romantic era.[^2] As cultural movements spread
across Europe, Italian musical innovations especially influenced German
composition. Organ building and composition were inextricably linked and
new developments in each field affected the other, and cultural and
religious values significantly influenced the development of the organ
and its music.

The ancient history of the organ is murky. Peter Williams makes this
quite clear. The organ was initially used in a secular context and often
only as a mechanical curiosity.[^3] Even how the organ came to be used
in churches is quite difficult to understand.[^4] This is compounded by
the loss of historical instruments and the difficulty of interpreting
primary sources.[^5] While the organ in some form was invented by
Ctesibius of Alexandria and organs performed at gladiatorial shows, many
questions remain of the exact form of the instrument and how it was
used. The organ continued in the Byzantine empire and emperors used it
for diplomatic gifts to European kings Pepin and Charlemagne.[^6] The
organ came to be used in churches in the tenth century, but how this
transition of purpose occurred is a mystery.[^7] Disputes within the
church also hindered the adoption of the instrument, particularly the
dispute between the Benedictines who favored the instrument for
liturgical use and the Cistercians who opposed it.[^8]

While the organ was used widely in churches in northern Italy and
northern Europe by the early fifteenth century, both the nature of the
instrument and when it would be used is difficult to ascertain. This is
largely because of the highly poetic or theoretical nature of the
primary sources. For example, Wulfstan, a monk, wrote a poem about the
organ at Winchester, using extremely hyperbolic and improbable language.
Theophilus wrote an encyclopedia on the manufacture of objects for
churches, describing a basic organ with slider keys instead of modern
keys which return to their original position after being pushed. The
anonymous Berne Codex described an organ with rudimentary keys. However,
all of these primary sources were primary theoretical and give little
insight into the true nature and use of the Medieval organ. How they fit
into liturgy is also unclear.[^9] Regardless, in the fourteenth century,
the mechanisms within the instrument started to resemble modern forms,
particularly with the invention of the tracker action, which allows the
complex arrangements of pipes associated with the modern organ.[^10]

Italy produced its own variation of the organ. This sort of organ was
largely developed by 1575. Italian organs featured large, shallow cases
with decorative, non-sounding pipes higher up. Italian organs rarely had
more than one manual and few had pedals aside from, occasionally, a few
pedals which pulled down the keys of the great organs. This style
remained dominant until the mid-nineteenth century, as did the practice
of relatively standardized registrations linked to certain parts of the
liturgy. As the Baroque era progressed, mixtures increasingly became
important, and stopped pipes were added to some second manuals. As any
people group wishes to prove their own cultural sophistication, the
Italians desired to compete with their northern neighbors and eventually
began to build instruments with a somewhat excess of special effects.
The traditional style remained common and popular, however, for both
builders and players.[^11]

Italian organ music was also a unique style. Italy produced several
genres of music for the organ, such as the toccata, ricercare, canzone,
and fantasia.[^12] The toccata emphasized virtuosic performance,
alternating many different types of writing in an artistic, in a *"stilo
fantastico*".[^13] The ricercare and canzone was adapted from the French
chanson and the motet. The ricercare, with a fugal structure, and
canzone, with its repetitive structure, later developed into the
fugue.[^14] The canzone was fast compared to the slower ricercare.[^15]
Frescobaldi seems to have considered the ricercare and fantasia to be
similar.[^16] The canzone often had both repetitive themes and great
variation within a piece.[^17] The nature of the Italian organ certainly
influenced these pieces: a distinct but well-balanced sound fostered
intricate counterpoint and the usual lack of pedals caused music to
generally lack pedal parts.[^18]

Since the organ is an instrument designed for the church, it follows
that its music develops in accordance with the needs of the liturgy.
Organ music was often used between the chants in the mass. Frescobaldi's
*Fiori Musicali* brought secular genres into a religions context, as
evidenced by the terms "Toccata avanti la Mess" ("Toccata before the
Mass), "Toccata per l'Elevazione" ("Toccata for the Elevation),
"Ricercare dopo il Credo" ("Ricercare after the Creed"), and "Canzone
dopo l'Epistola" and "dopo il Post Comune" ("Canzone after the Epistle"
and "after the Postcommunion").[^19] By using these titles, Frescobaldi
signaled what each piece could be used for, fulfilling his desire to
"help organists...so that they will be able to respond at Mass and
Vespers."[^20]

Little development in Italian organ composition occurred after
Frescobaldi, as orchestral and vocal music became more important.
Bernard Sonnaillon notes that there may be a correlation between the
stagnation of the organ and the lack of later innovation in genres
specific to the music.[^21] This seems correct, as Frescobaldi lived
from 1583 to 1643, and published his *Fiori musicali* in 1635;[^22]
thus, the chronological correlation seems quite strong. It seems
possible, though, that the gradually increasing importance of orchestral
and vocal music may have also been to blame for the lack of new
development in the organ. Thus, many entangled factors working together
caused Italian organs and their music to lose importance and innovation
for the remainder of the Baroque period. Even the harpsichord with its
crisp sound began to influence organ music towards its own idiom in the
early 1700s, manifest in the works of composers such as Pasquini,
Zipoli, and others who wrote pieces suitable for either instrument.[^23]

Arnolt Schlick in *Spiegel der Orgelmacher* laid out the principles of
organ building which would become predominant at the beginning of the
modern period, particularly the construction and contrast of the manuals
in pedals. In some ways, Schlick's music anticipated the organ chorales
that would become common in the Baroque period. Near the end of the
fourteenth century, *Werkprinzip* ("system of independent chests"),
became a dominant force in German organ-building. All of these organs
were, as Williams says, "full of color,"[^24] or, in other words, with
large numbers of exotic stops in a *Brustwerk and Rückpositiv*.[^25] Arp
Schnitger's large organs were considered to be the best model of
organ-building through the mid-nineteenth century.[^26] A typical
example of his work was his organ in the Jakobikirche in Hamburg. This
organ had four manuals and a pedal, each contrasting with each other in
accordance with *Werkprinzip*. The *Pedal* was the heaviest rank, while
the heaviest manual was the *Hauptwerk* (Great Organ); the organ also
included a *Brustwerk* (where swell stops were sometimes included), the
*Oberwerk,* and the *Rückpositiv.*[^27]

German organ music is quite diverse. Early manuscripts such as the
tablature *Buxheimer Orgelbuch* show an emphasis on the pedal as more
than mere accompaniment. Arnolt Schlick noted that this type of
importance on the pedal usually precluded the use of 16' stops.[^28] The
extent to which the pedal became integral to the harmony and structure
of composition is evident.[^29] The development of organ music seems to
have interrupted by the events in Europe following the reformation, as
the early sixteenth century witnessed a dearth in composition. There
were two primary schools of German organ composition: the northern and
the southern. Composers from central Germany formed somewhat of a middle
ground between these two schools.[^30]

The southern German composers were greatly influenced by Italians. Many
musicians, such as Froberger studied in Italy with important figures
such as Frescobaldi,[^31] carrying musical ideas and composition
techniques into the region. The influence of Italian tradition upon
their style is quite evident; the style and genres Froberger used, for
example, parallel the style and forms of his teacher Frescobaldi.[^32]
Additionally, the liturgy of the region affected the development of the
region's music. *Cantus firmus*[^33] music as in Italy was dominant in
composition rather than the *Choral* of Northern Germany.[^34]

Similarly to in Italy, the southern German organ competed with solo
instrumentalists and even the harpsichord, weakening its importance;
many of these musicians were not specialist performers on the organ and
had more general duties. For example, Froberger did not particularly
favor the organ over the harpsichord, and, while distinct genres did
develop for each instrument, the harpsichord still dominated the efforts
of composers.[^35]

With Frescobaldi's influence continuing in southern Germany, southern
German composers Pachelbel influenced central German composers. Thus,
Italian influence percolated through Germany. While Pachelbel was a
southern German, he was notably a protestant in a generally Catholic
region. He certainly fell within the influence of the Italian tradition
and wrote in its forms, but nevertheless developed the protestant
chorale.[^36] His works make this synthesis quite clear; even his
chorales display stylistic inheritance from the Italians, even using
Italian forms in the chorale genre while adapting to and embracing the
advantages of the German instrument.[^37]

In the north, however, the organ dominated the musical scene. Under the
influence of Jan Pieterzoon Sweelink and the rich Lutheran hymnody
tradition, northern German music blossomed into its own unique regional
variation.[^38] These hymns often were arranged in the organ choral
genre.[^39] The northern German organ also influenced the style of
composition. Because of the size of instruments, including the pedals,
and the organization of the instrument in accordance with the
*Werkprinzip*, composers such as Buxtehude to effectively use the pedals
as an integral part of composition.[^40] This resulted in a unique set
of forms of chorale: the *Choralvorspiel (*chorale prelude), the chorale
fantasia, and the chorale variation or fugue. The prelude relied on
straightforward *cantus firmus* composition; the fantasia expounded
extensively on each portion of the melody using many techniques; the
chorale fugue used a fugal introduction to *cantus firmus* composition
and was influenced by the Italian *stilo fantastico* toccatas.[^41]

Central German composers held somewhat of a middle ground between the
south and the north. They had more diverse duties than the northern
organists, but they also were not taken away from the organ by other
duties. Central German organ music was slow to develop, perhaps because
of the difficulties of the Thirty-Years war, but soon Michael Praetorius
in his *Musae Sioniae* was writing *cantus firmus* music suited for the
local instrument and liturgy.[^42] Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow, influenced
by Pachelbel, wrote chorales which pointed towards Bach.[^43] Johann
Kuhnau wrote various keyboard works, including toccatas influenced by
Froberger which used the pedals in a northern style and chaconnes
influenced by Pachelbel.[^44] Johann Gottfried Walther, a cousin and
friend of J. S. Bach, wrote fantasias in a northern style and chorale
preludes with the melody in long treble or bass notes; some of his
chorales could be played on instruments without pedals, possibly a
concession to the Italian influence on the area. He also wrote
transcriptions of both Italian and German violin concertos, displaying a
methodical amalgamation of styles.[^45] The compositions of Johann
Sebastian Bach stand out as "a kind apotheosis" of organ composition;
indeed, he combined the various areas and genres of music in such a
fashion that he both sums up and completes the German Baroque organ
composition tradition.[^46] Bach agreed with Werckmeister that music was
the "reflection and foretaste of a heavenly harmony"[^47] and certainly
seems to have achieved this in his compositions, especially his organ
chorales.[^48]

The organ was affected by many cultural factors, political, religious,
and geographic. These factors resulted in many regional and temporal
variations of the instrument, including the large German organ and the
simpler Italian organ. Since each region also produced its own music, it
follows that music is often quite tied to the nature of the organ, and
the nature of the organ to the music. Additionally, music was also
affected by cultural factors; thus, the instrument itself could in turn
be affected. This has special implications for performers of organ
music, as one must be careful to play with an appropriate style of
instrument and combination of stops if the performer desires to play in
a historically accurate manner and, presumably, in accord with the
composer's intentions. It also has great importance to modern organ
builders, who must consider what types of music will be played on their
instruments to make the instruments suitable for their purpose. A sort
of organ revival which focused on German models began to occur in the
early twentieth century, incorporating historical research to produce a
historically accurate instrument which would accurately represent the
music of the time.[^49]This is a complex topic which deserves treatment
so that the music of the great Baroque composers can truly be
appreciated.
